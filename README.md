## Contribution guidelines

PRs are most welcome! I am not a pro UI/UX designer and so there is a lot of room for improvement. Attempts to improve the theme will be highly appreciated. Also, it may be better to first create an issue describing the problem the PR fixes and then create it, in order to get more alternate views on the problem.
